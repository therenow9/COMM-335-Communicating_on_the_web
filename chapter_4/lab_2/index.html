			<p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
				and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit
				organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
			<p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
				also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
				into their natural environment.</p>
			<p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care
				for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor.
