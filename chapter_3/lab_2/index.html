			<p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release
				wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit organization
				dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
			<p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also provide
				long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into their natural
				environment.</p>
			<p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our
				animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor. Contact
				us today.</p>
