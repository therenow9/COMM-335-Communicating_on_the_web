		<p>During the summer in between my sophmore and junior year I was able to join a

			chance to prove myself in the field. I started out as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
			technician
			and
			programmer.
			When I

			the team my boss and company founder, was the only software developer at the time. He decided to
			shift
			my
			duties to include more Software Development focused work including python, MYSQL, Linux with
			Raspberry PI and some work with Windows Server Powershell. Over the
			course
			of my internship, we did projects for Amazon, Pampered Chef, Eby Brown, and Bd Sparks. This startup
			had grown dramatically
			from
			when
			I had joined until when I left, and I hope to see the copmany continue to grow and expand.
			Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this as an internship at my
			university. (This Internship Presentation can be viewed <a

			entirely by
			himself, using
			YoYo Studios Gamemaker Studio, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with
			Object-Oriented
			functions, pixel art
			editor and much more. I spent the entire summer after my freshman year working nonstop on my
			MacBook
			air and learning the
			fundamentals of
			programming as well as game design, and pixel art by working with Game Maker Studio 2. I
			continued
			working
			on game
			development in my free time throughout the next school year and even learned a bit of audio
			production
			to produce my own
			music for the games since I took piano lessons for quite a few years. (If you are curious
			about
			the
			music, you
			can
			check that out <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeremy-scheuerman-76586" target="_blank">here</a>.)

		<p>As my projects grew larger in scale, my MacBook Air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high

			due to its lack

			i5
			processor, building my

			32
			gigabytes of RAM. This
			was a neat experience, because this was the first time I had ever built a PC or really
			worked
			with
			computer hardware
			hands on. Since then I have built multiple computers for others, and I haven’t been scared
			to
			open computers, swap parts, repair computers,
			laptops,
			game consoles etc.
			I’ve fixed computers, upgraded computers and even broken a couple machines by accident in
			the
			process,
			it’s all part of

		<p>During the first semester of my senior year, I participated in Salisbury’s WXSU radio club to
			host a podcast. This
			semester, as a personal project,
			I offered to rebuild their
			entire website from the ground up as it was old and desperately needed to be updated. The
			old site which you can view
			<a href="https://orgs.salisbury.edu/wxsu/">here</a> (for now) was quite rough. The visual
			design was outdated and many of the links didn't work properly. This site also
			lacked organization as well as the ability to listen to the radio station live straight from
			in site. My Partner and I rebuilt the
			entire website from a blank slate from the ground up. I used CSS flexbox as well as media
			queries to ensure responsive
			design. I built a responsive nav bar with some JavaScript and a dedicated page
			for forms to apply to host
			a show. The coolest feature I added was the ability to listen to the show straight from the
			websites home page. I
			achieved this by embedding the caster.fm player into the site, I also hyperlinked the
			station’s phone number right above
			it, so in just a couple clicks you can call into the show live. Salisbury currently hasn’t
			put up the site yet (they are
			planning to soon) as there are some technical formalities that need to be gone through with
			the university for it to be
			posted by them. However, you can check it out here on my GitHub pages to see the full site.
