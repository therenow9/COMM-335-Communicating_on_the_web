				<h2 class="sub-title">My interests</h2>
				<p>I am into everything technology, including computer programming, hardware,
					administration, as well as software and web development. Additionally, I
					am also very into videogames, music, television, film. I have even gone
					into development of a little bit of each with a history of developing videogames,
					music for said games, as well as a current documentary home movie I am making
					right now with some friends.</p>
				<h2 class="sub-title">Software Development and programming.</h2>
				<p>I am pursuing a career in technology specifically computer programming
					with a focus in full stack development. I completed my minor in computer
					science here at Salisbury university which focuses on the fundamentals of
					programming as well as data structures and algorithms. In my spare time
					I have pursued many types of projects to help expand my skillset. This includes
					but is not limited to, creating videogames, making websites, creating and
					managing my server, and learning new technologies that I am interested in.
					I think what interests me most about full stack development is that it includes
					a bit of everything, the web development and front-end side of things, the
					backend, database, and deployment / server admin. I enjoy this because I
					definitely am a bit of all trades when it comes to my skills in development,
					I feel this position would suit me well.</p>
				<h2 class="sub-title">Music</h2>
				<p>I enjoy a lot of different types of music, a lot of videogame soundtracks
					as well. The soundtracks to Nintendo’s Mother series are probably my favorite
					albums of all time. I also enjoy more popular and recognizable artists like
					Juice Wrld, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan , Queen, Abba, and many others. I have
					also had some experience with making music for my games, you can listen
					to a couple tracks I have developed below in the embedded Spotify links.</p>

				<h2 class="sub-title">Videogames</h2>
				<p>Ever since I was a child, I always enjoyed videogames. I grew up playing
					most of the Nintendo Games out there like Mario kart, super smash brothers,
					Punch out, Super Mario brothers, Zelda, Metroid and Pokémon Just to name
					a few. I also enjoy a wide variety of game genres, like RPGS, shooters,
					platformers, and all other types. Nintendo’s earthbound series and Toby
					Fox’s Undertale are the games that inspired me to start learning game development.
					This is what ultimately pushed me into pursuing a career in software development,
					and without my passion for gaming, I never would have got into my career
					of programming. A few of my favorite videogames are, The Legend of Zelda
					Breath of the Wild, Mother 3, Metal Gear solid V, Super Mario Galaxy, Batman
					Arkham City, and Luigi’s Mansion. I even did a podcast talking about gaming
					right here at Salisbury’s student run radio station WXSU, I embedded a link
					to the first episode below. </p>

				<h2 class="sub-title">Tv and Film</h2>
				<p>Like many people I am very much enjoy television and film. This was a
					big reason I pursued the Media Production Major here at SU. I enjoyed learning
					about all of the aspects of the film making process and seeing how it all
					works behind the scenes. For television some of my favorite shows are, Mr.
					Robot, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, The Venture Brothers, and Breaking Bad. For
					movies my favorites are The Truman Show, The Dark Knight, The Thing, and
					The Wolf of Wall Street. I enjoyed making films for class so much that my
					friends and I are undertaking our own projects to make a documentary of
					all of us having fun at college before we graduate. I had barely dabbled
					with making film outside of class before, so this has been a really fun
					experience and I am excited to see the end result.</p>
